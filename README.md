Practice various data science problems

### Credit:
I took various dataset from https://data-flair.training/blogs/

I don't strictly follow the instructions on the guidance nor the source code. I follow my own flow design and intuitive, and make my own experiments from there.

All the datasets seems to be "clean", that says, without any data preparation step, we are good to go. In my point of view, it is a let-down if we are going to work with real-life data science projects, which involve heavily on this step. I will try to find the raw data somewhere else... 

I managed to create codes that are highly re-useable without any heavy modifications from project to project. Their architecture follows the same philosophy, so although there are modifications / additional modules depending on the project or the dataset, the main structure of the code doesn't need to change.
